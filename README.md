#### Project Update

Hi everyone — I've been inactive on this project for a while due to other commitments. I'm now actively looking for contributors and maintainers to help keep the project alive and growing.

If you're interested in contributing — whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or developing new features — please open an issue to introduce yourself.

I'm also open to adding trusted collaborators with commit access who demonstrate consistent contributions and interest.

Thanks for being part of the community and keeping Linux-WiFi-Hotspot going!

### Features

* Share your wifi like in Windows - Use wifi and enable hotspot at the same time.
* Share a wifi access point from any network interface
* [Create a hotspot with VPN](#vpn-hotspot) - The hotspot has the traffic tunnelled through VPN. Useful for devices with no VPN app support like TV or gaming consoles.
* Share wifi via QR code
* MAC filter
* View connected devices
* Includes Both command line and GUI.
* Support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz (Need to be compatible with your wifi adapter). Ex: You have connected to the 5GHz network and share a connection with 2.4GHz.
* Customise wifi Channel, Change MAC address, etc.
* Hide SSID

### Notes

- Sometimes there are troubles with **5Ghz bands** due to some vendor restrictions. If you cannot start the hotspot while you are connected to the 5Ghz band, Unselect **Auto** and select **2.4Ghz** in frequency selection.

- If any problems with **RealTeK Wifi Adapters** see [this](docs/howto/realtek.md)

- **Unable to allocate IP: firewalld issue:** Please check for potential fixes: [#209](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/209) [#166](https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot/issues/166)
